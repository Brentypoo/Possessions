Possessions keeps track of gold and items across all of your
characters on each server. Its primary utility comes from being able to
use a slash command to instantly show you where you already possess an
item on the server without cluttering your tooltips all the time.

Commands:

/poss – Open the possessions window

/poss text – Open Possessions and search for “text”

/poss [Item Link] – Open Possessions and search for the item linked
